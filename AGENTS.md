# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Project Context

This is the `digital.vasic.config` Go module -- a configuration management library. It is a standalone module with no application binary; it provides packages for import by other projects.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Do not add a `main.go`** -- this is a library module, not an application.
2. **All public functions must have doc comments** following Go conventions.
3. **Tests use `testify`** (`assert` and `require`) -- do not introduce other test frameworks.
4. **Error messages** should use lowercase and wrap with `%w` where applicable.
5. **No external dependencies** beyond `testify` for testing -- keep the dependency footprint minimal.

## Testing

Run all tests before submitting changes:

```bash
go test ./... -count=1
```

Every new public function must have corresponding test coverage.

## Package Boundaries

- `pkg/config` -- file I/O only, no env var logic
- `pkg/env` -- env var loading only, no file I/O
- `pkg/validator` -- pure validation logic, no I/O of any kind

Keep these boundaries clean. Cross-package imports within this module should be avoided.


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**


### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ZERO UNFINISHED WORK POLICY

NO unfinished work, TODOs, or known issues may remain in the codebase. EVER.

PROHIBITED: TODO/FIXME comments, empty implementations, silent errors, fake data, unwrap() calls that panic, empty catch blocks.

REQUIRED: Fix ALL issues immediately, complete implementations before committing, proper error handling in ALL code paths, real test assertions.

Quality Principle: If it is not finished, it does not ship. If it ships, it is finished.
